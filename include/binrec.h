 * General notes
 * =============
 *
 * In this header (and the library source code in general), "guest" refers
 * to the source CPU or architecture, i.e. the input to the translator,
 * and "host" or "native" refers to the target CPU or architecture, i.e.
 * the output of the translator.  (In a few function names, such as
 * binrec_native_arch(), "native" is used to refer to the runtime
 * environment when considered as a translator output architecture.)
 * A program which calls into code generated by this library is referred
 * to as a "client program".
 *
 * The numeric values of constants and the layout of structures in this
 * header are _not_ part of the public API; always use the symbolic names
 * rather than the numeric values or offsets when writing code which
 * interfaces to the library.  The library ABI (including those values and
 * offsets) will be kept consistent through revisions of a major version,
 * such that a program compiled against library version x.y (x >= 1) will
 * also run correctly using library version x.z (if z < y, features such
 * as optimization flags only defined later than version x.z may be
 * ignored, but the generated code will behave in a compatible manner).
 * However, the ABI may change between major versions, or at any time
 * before version 1.0.
 *
 *
 * Guest-specific notes
 * ====================
 *
 * The abbreviation "PSB" below refers to the processor state block, i.e.
 * the structure containing the current state of the guest processor.
 *
 * libbinrec is designed to allow a certain amount of flexibility in the
 * structure of the PSB.  The binrec_setup_t structure includes
 * "state_offsets_*" sub-structures for specifying the byte offset of
 * various members of the PSB; the client program should fill in the
 * structure appropriate to the selected guest architecture with the
 * relevant offsets within its PSB structure.
 *
 * PowerPC 32-bit architectures (BINREC_ARCH_PPC_7XX)
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Floating-point registers in the PSB are assumed to be stored as pairs
 * of 64-bit floating point ("double"-type) values, with the first value
 * of each pair holding the value of that register as a scalar or the ps0
 * slot of the register for paired-single mode, and the second value of
 * each pair holding the value of the ps1 slot for paired-single mode.
 * The translated code will take care of converting between single and
 * double precision as needed.  Note that the FPR array must be aligned to
 * a multiple of 16 bytes to avoid crashes due to misaligned accesses.
 *
 * Full floating-point exception handling bloats the translated code
 * significantly; in particular, paired-single arithmetic instructions
 * require several hundred host instructions each to correctly identify
 * all possible combinations of exception conditions, though most of
 * those instructions will be skipped for any particular execution of the
 * operation.  Client programs should enable as many of the floating-point
 * optimization flags as possible for best performance; even those marked
 * UNSAFE are in fact safe for the vast majority of real-world code.  In
 * particular, if the guest code does not read FPSCR or set any of the
 * FPSCR exception enable bits, enabling BINREC_OPT_G_PPC_NO_FPSCR_STATE
 * can improve performance of floating-point code by a factor of 10 or
 * more.  If necessary, specific optimizations can be safely disabled for
 * individual blocks of guest code; changing optimization flags for one
 * translation unit will have no effect on the behavior of any other
 * translated code.
 *
 * The FEX and VX bits in FPSCR are not written to the copy of FPSCR
 * stored in the PSB, but are instead generated when needed by a
 * floating-point instruction with Rc=1 or the mffs or mcrfs instructions.
 * (This mimics the implementation of the bits on PowerPC CPUs: they have
 * no associated physical storage, and instead are hardwired to the
 * appropriate function of other FPSCR bits.)  Client code which needs to
 * check the state of FPSCR[FEX] or FPSCR[VX] should manually compute them
 * based on the relevant exception and mask bits.
 *
 * Translated code assumes that the host's floating-point rounding mode is
 * set based on FPSCR[RN] and all host floating-point exception flags are
 * clear on entry.  The code will maintain these invariants on all
 * outbound control transfers, so a client program which does not perform
 * any floating-point operations or modify FPSCR on its own only needs to
 * set host floating-point state once, before first calling translated code.
 *
 * The FPSCR[FR] bit is not set by any floating-point instructions, though
 * it can be written as usual by instructions which directly manipulate
 * FPSCR.
 *
 * The overflow and underflow exception enable bits (OE and UE) in FPSCR
 * are ignored; floating-point operations are performed as if both
 * exceptions are masked (FPSCR[OE]=0 and FPSCR[UE]=0).  However,
 * FPSCR[FEX] will still reflect the state of the OE and UE bits actually
 * stored in FPSCR, so (for example) an Rc=1 instruction that generates an
 * overflow exception with FPSCR[OE]=1 will set cr1.FEX to 1.
 *
 * The "non-IEEE" (NI) flag in FPSCR is ignored; floating-point operations
 * will always be performed in full precision.
 *
 * libbinrec implements the implementation-specific behavior of 32-bit
 * PowerPC processors (at least the 750CL) that single-precision
 * floating-point instructions accept double-precision operands, including
 * the quirk that a double-precision frC operand to a single-precision
 * multiply or multiply-add instruction is rounded to 24 bits (this latter
 * behavior can be suppressed with the BINREC_OPT_G_PPC_FAST_FMULS
 * optimization flag).
 *
 * The conditional load/store instructions (lwarx and stwcx.) rely on
 * hardware support for their behavior.  Since such hardware support is
 * not necessarily available in the host environment, and since a correct
 * implementation requires knowledge of that environment which is not
 * available to libbinrec, these instructions are implemented using a
 * compare-and-swap heuristic: an stwcx. after a lwarx succeeds if the
 * value at the target address is unchanged from the value it had when the
 * lwarx was executed.  Translated code for lwarx and stwcx makes use of
 * two PSB fields: reserve_flag (an 8-bit Boolean value), which records
 * whether an lwarx is pending, and reserve_state (a 32-bit integer value),
 * which stores the value loaded by the most recent lwarx.  This can result
 * in incorrect behavior if the guest code expects the store to fail due to
 * writes of an identical value or writes a new value using a regular store
 * between the conditional load and store, but this heuristic should
 * suffice for typical programs.  Note that the address of the lwarx is
 * _not_ saved; a stwcx. to a different address will still succeed if that
 * address contains the same value as was loaded by the lwarx instruction.
 * (This matches the behavior of actual PowerPC CPUs in the sense that
 * address mismatches between lwarx and stwcx. are ignored.)
 *
 * Access to the time base registers via the mftb instruction is
 * implemented by calling a host-side callback function, a pointer to
 * which should be stored in the PSB at the offset indicated by
 * state_offsets_ppc.timebase_handler.  The signature of the function is
 * "uint64_t handler(PSB *)", taking the pointer to the PSB which was
 * passed to the translated code and returning the current 64-bit time
 * base value.  If the function pointer is NULL, reads of the time base
 * registers will always return zero.
 *
 * Exceptions generated by the system call (sc) and trap (tw/twi)
 * instructions are implemented as control transfers to host-side
 * functions, pointers to which should be stored in the PSB at the offsets
 * indicated by state_offsets_ppc.sc_handler and .trap_handler
 * respectively.  The signature of the functions is:
 *      void sc_handler(PSB *, uint32_t insn);
 *      void trap_handler(PSB *);
 * taking the pointer to the PSB which was passed to the translated code
 * and, for the sc handler, the instruction word which caused the call.
 * The value of the NIA field in the PSB is set as the SRR0 register would
 * be set on a true PowerPC processor: to the address of the trap
 * instruction for trap exceptions, and to the address of the instruction
 * _following_ the sc instruction for system call exceptions (but see also
 * the BINREC_OPT_G_PPC_SC_BLR optimization flag).  The translated code
 * will return immediately to its caller when the handler returns, and the
 * call to the handler may in fact be translated as a tail call.  The
 * translated code does not check for NULL function pointers, so it will
 * crash if an exception occurs and the associated function pointer is
 * not set.
 *
 * All instruction words with the primary opcode of the sc instruction
 * (0x11) are decoded as that instruction.  This deviates from the PowerPC
 * specification, in which only the instruction 0x4400_0002 is a valid sc
 * instruction, but is done to allow the use of that instruction as (for
 * example) a callout to native code in a PowerPC system emulator in which
 * the specific function to call is encoded in the instruction word.  If
 * this behavior is not desired, the system call handler can simply treat
 * any instruction word other than 0x4400_0002 as an illegal instruction.
 *
 * libbinrec ignores the icbi instruction, except in that execution will
 * always return to the caller after icbi.  If the guest program generates
 * and executes new (guest) code on the fly, the libbinrec client should
 * check after each block of translated code returns whether the
 * instruction immediately preceding NIA is an icbi instruction, and take
 * appropriate action if so.
 *
 * If a D-form (immediate offset) load or store instruction has an offset
 * which causes the final address to wrap around the 32-bit address space,
 * such as lwz rD,16(rA) where the value of rA is 0xFFFF_FFF0 or greater,
 * the access will improperly "leak" outside the guest memory region.
 * However, accesses to the top 32k of memory using single-register (not
 * lmw/stmw) D-form instructions with rA = 0 are handled correctly.
 *
 * Some obscure hardware quirks are not emulated by the translated code;
 * see the list of expected failures in tests/guest-ppc/exec/750cl-common.i
 * for details.
 *
 *
 * Host-specific notes
 * ===================
 *
 * Intel/AMD x86 64-bit architecture (BINREC_ARCH_X86_64_*)
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Translated code assumes support for all instruction set extensions
 * through SSE3.  (More specifically, the following CPUID feature bits are
 * assumed to be set: CMOV, SSE, SSE2, and SSE3.)  Use of later extensions
 * can be enabled by setting appropriate feature bits (BINREC_FEATURE_X86_*)
 * in the host_features field of binrec_setup_t.
 *
 * Translated code must be located at a 16-byte-aligned address for correct
 * behavior.  If the code is not correctly aligned, certain floating-point
 * operations may raise exceptions (specifically the general-protection
 * exception, "#GP" as described in Intel documentation).  libbinrec will
 * always request 16-byte alignment if a code_malloc() callback is supplied.
 *
 * Translated code maintains the host stack at 16-byte alignment, as
 * required by both System V and Windows ABIs.  If the client program calls
 * translated code with a misaligned stack, floating-point code may raise
 * exceptions due to unaligned stack accesses.
 *
 * Loads of 64-bit floating point ("double") 2-element vectors must be
 * 16-byte aligned, or an exception will be raised.  Other data types can
 * be loaded from any alignment, though values not aligned to a multiple of
 * the value size may take additional CPU cycles to load.
 *
 * Full (non-rounding) support for fused multiply-add operations is only
 * implemented for CPUs which support the FMA3 instruction set.  If the
 * BINREC_FEATURE_X86_FMA feature flag is not set in the setup structure
 * passed to binrec_create_handle(), fused multiply-add operations will be
 * translated to separate multiply and add instructions, which will cause
 * the intermediate result to be rounded; this in turn may cause
 * floating-point exceptions to be incorrectly raised in certain edge cases
 * (such as HUGE_VAL * HUGE_VAL - inf, in which the multiplication rounds
 * to infinity and the resulting subtraction of infinities triggers an
 * exception).
 *
 * The prohibition on tail calls in the Windows SEH ABI also prevents the
 * use of dynamic chaining, so calling binrec_enable_chaining() has no
 * effect when the host architecture is BINREC_ARCH_X86_64_WINDOWS_SEH.
 * If a logging callback function is provided, a warning to this effect
 * will be emitted if binrec_enable_chaning() is called with a true value
 * for the enable parameter.

/*--------------------- General optimization flags ----------------------*/

/*
 * Optimizations performed by the library can generally be classified into
 * three types:
 *
 * - Behavior-safe: optimizations which purely affect the size or speed of
 *   the generated code and have no effect on behavior.  Optimizations
 *   such as constant folding and deconditioning fall into this category.
 *   Optimizations can be assumed to fall under this category where not
 *   otherwise documented.
 *
 * - Specification-safe: optimizations which may change the behavior of
 *   the generated code, but only within limits prescribed by the relevant
 *   specification.  For example, the NATIVE_IEEE_UNDERFLOW optimization
 *   may change the results of certain floating-point operations relative
 *   to the results returned by guest code running on its native hardware,
 *   but the IEEE floating-point specification allows either of two
 *   behaviors, so with respect to that specification, the optimized code
 *   is no less correct than the original.  As long as the guest code was
 *   written to follow the specifications rather than the precise behavior
 *   of the guest hardware, it will still behave correctly under these
 *   optimizations.
 *
 * - Unsafe: optimizations which can materially impact the behavior of the
 *   generated code, such as stack frame optimization.  These optimizations
 *   can benefit code which rigorously adhere to the relevant assumptions,
 *   such as code produced by a high-level language compiler, but they can
 *   cause nonconformant code to misbehave or even crash.  Documentation
 *   for an unsafe optimization will clearly indicate that fact.
