libbinrec version history
=========================

Version 0.2
-----------
Changes:
- Moved binrec_setup_t state offset fields to an architecture-specific
  structure (binrec_setup_ppc_t) to ease future addition of guest
  architectures.
- Translated blocks now return the processor state block pointer as a
  return value, so calls to subsequent blocks don't need to re-fetch it.
- PowerPC sc and trap handler functions are now expected to return the
  PSB pointer.  This may be a pointer to a different PSB, such as when a
  virtual system call migrated the calling thread to a different virtual
  processor.


Version 0.1
-----------
Initial release.
